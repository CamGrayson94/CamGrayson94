## Cameron Grayson's Portfolio

Hello, welcome to my portfolio! I’m Cameron Grayson, and I am a recent Data Science graduate and aspiring Data Analytics professional. 
The purpose of this page is to showcase my skills working with various tools that may be used in Data Analytics.

My portfolio is broken down into two sections (repositories) as follows:
- Personal Projects
- University Projects

To navigate, choose 'Repositories' at the top, and choose the repository you would like to view.
Each repository has a readme file that will display with information about each project within.
If you would like to view the contents of the project, click on the project's folder (located at the top of the repository).

### I am currently waiting on University permission to post projects.

I can be reached at camgrayson94@gmail.com with any questions.

Thank you for visiting!
