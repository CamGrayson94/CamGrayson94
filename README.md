Hello, welcome to my portfolio! I’m Cameron Grayson, and I am a recent Data Science graduate and aspiring Data Analytics professional. 
The purpose of this page is to showcase my skills working with various tools that may be used in Data Analytics.

My portfolio is broken down into two sections as follows:
- School Projects
- Personal Projects

I will post a readme file in each folder outlining the tools and concepts used in the projects contained in that folder.

In order to protect the privacy of my solutions to school projects, this folder will be password protected. 
If you would like to view these projects (and have not been given a password already), please contact me at the email address listed below.

I can be reached at camgrayson94@gmail.com

Thank you for visiting!
